JOke: My Son has Autism   7-3-14


(T2C)

The Doctor told me my 3 year old son has Autism.
I asked what are the symptoms?

The Doc said he ...
 * Spits Stuff out of his mouth 
 * He tensis up when he is angry with flashes of attiude or emotionally unstable.
 * He Ignores everything you say but some how still hears you and respond when he feels like it.

I said Doc! Thats not Autism (pause) that Feminasim. I think my son is Gay!
