T2C: Yaw Like Kanya west?


Did yaw know this fool has tour called the "Jesus tour!"


When I heard that I was pissed off!

I was like "Damn! I been praying for to be rich, to have my movies made and to find a sexy wife so I can get rid of the mean ass wife that I got now at home!

and aint none of my prayers got answered yet.

 And Its all because Jesus (strech the name jesus).... has been on tour with Kanya west! Aint that a bitch!

Jesus is on Tour drinking bottles of whine (improve holding the mic like he is parting and drunk! then talking to Kanya... "YO KANAY... 
THIS NICE POOL IN THIS HOTEL. YOU SEE ME DO A TRICK. WATCH ME WALK ON THIS WATER (try and get the dj to play a song)."


Jesus is on tour having fun... talk smack at the party... "Kanya lets get this party started. "POOF!" Kanya... 
"Jesus you put the bush on fire!" Jesus.."Dont panic just go over there and smoke it!"
Kanya..."Jesus what kinda of hydro is this. Its incredible!"   Jesus... "I know! I know! why do think moses was gone for a month? After he inhaled the burning bush he passed out."


(pause)

THE JESUS TOUR!


Now I got to go buy a concert ticket and hope to get backstage passes just to get my prayers answered.

Kanya running around here making all this damn money (pause), he got a fine ass girl and new born baby (pause)....
 all because Kanya been keeping Jesus all to him self! I am mad as hell.

Jesus I can sing too. I might not be able to pay you as much (pause). But come on jesus lets talk!"


I know now if dont catch jesus when he comes town at the Staple Center, I might not ever see him again. 
DAMIT I GOT TO GET MY TICKET! I cant afford to be chasing Jesus all across the world - this can be expensive.
I am have to break out my own COLLECTION PLATE at the comdey shows!

(imporv to the crowd: "excuse can i get $25 dollars. I need to raise money so i can go TRY to meet Jesus. He is on tour with Kanya in Ahampnser Damn!")


(pause)

THE JESUS TOUR!
