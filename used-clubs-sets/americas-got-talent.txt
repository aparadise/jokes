joke--- americas got talent...


i dont like shows like americas got talent because it realy discuss me, after i see a 9 year kid singing
a song BETTER than the orignial person who wrote it... 

(pause with discuss)

I just look over at my 15 year old son and be like... 

"you know what? you aint gonna be about shit are you!
 your gonna be a complete faliure arent you.
That kid is 9 years old and can play the piono with no fingers.

fuckin look at you!

I got to pretend i m addriene peterson and take off my belt just to get you take out the damn trash.

TURN THE CHANNEL BEFORE I GO TO JAIL 2nite!"


(t2 crowd)

Come on i cant be the only one. hell.
some of you parents are braging and busting out your cameras recording your kid saying...
"oh look my kid he is 11 years old he can do a CARP-WHEEL"

NO! stop! dont nobody wants to see that bullshit. your kid is not special.

a 9 year old play Ba-toven with is elbows is special!
