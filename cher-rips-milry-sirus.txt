Cher rips Miley's dancing, song, physique, oral hygiene on her MTV stage performance with Robin Thick

"I'm not old-fashioned," Cher tells USA TODAY in an interview to promote new album Closer to the Truth.
 "She could have come out naked, and if she'd just rocked the house, I would have said, 'You go, girl.' 
It just wasn't done well. She can't dance, her body looked like hell,
 the song wasn't great, one cheek was hanging out. And, chick, don't stick out your tongue if it's coated."

WOW... all i have to say... is how did that old azz bitch see her toungh.
You lessibians dont fuck around. (lol)
