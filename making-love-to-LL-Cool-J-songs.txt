"making love to rap songs"

(talk to a young couple in the crowd and tease them about there sex life and ask what music you like to fuck to?)

I didn't know the level of sexual chemistry you can make with a women to a slow jam until I was like 
maybe 19 or 20 when the group 'Color me Bad' had a cut called "Sex you up!"

(ask the dj to play the song at 2:54)
(when the song is over ask the girl who is with the guy ... did he ever sing to yo ass say "I WANNA MAKE LOVE TO YOU... YEAHHH! OOOHHHH OOOHHHH YEAHHH! FEELS SO RIGHT IT CANT BE WRONG!")

(t2c)
she looking at me like knawww nigga, but you can! (laugh)

Nigga I use to wear out the 24 min single super exteded remix of that tape on side-A and side-B like it was no tommorow.

Serioulsly...

I didn't even know shit about love songs! Most men dont even know how to make love until there in there 30s.
 
If a women came into my bedroom the musis I was playing to set the mood to have sex too was
Too Short, NWA, 2 live crew and Snoop dogg songs! There was no way I fucking to and LL COOL J song titled "I need love".


(t2c)

After a girl walked out of my house looking tore the hell up wig all backwards and shit and one of her High Heel pumps all broken.
Her ass be limping back to her friends appartment looking a zombie.
 (friend)
Her best friends be looking at her saying... "damng girl what happend to you?"

(she replies)
Girl... I think I just got gang banged by the fat boys.
