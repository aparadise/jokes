"making love to LL cool j songs"

(talk to a young couple in the crowd and tease them about there sex life and ask what music you like to fuck to?)

I didn't know the leval of sexual chemistry you can make with a women to slow jam until I was like 
maybe 19 or 20 when the Color me Bad had a cut called "Sex you up!"

Nigga I use to wear out the 24 min single exteded remix of that tape on side-A 
and side-B like it was no tommorow.

Serioulsly...
I didn't even know shit about love songs hell NO dude knows about how to make love until there 30s.
If a women came into my bedroom we was having sex to the Too Short and west coat gangsta music.
every now and then I would hit that to some LL COOl J.

(improv sex and sing the word...
LL Cool J is hard as hell!
Battle anyone I dont care you tell!
I excel they All fail!
Gonna crack shells, Double-L must rock the bells!)

I have after getting wore out to all them hard core rappers I have a girl walking out my house looking tore the 
hell up wig all backwards and shit. High Heel pumps broken. she wearing one shoe in the left hand and limping 
with one shoe on her right foot walking like a zombie back home.

Her girl friends be looking at her saying "damng girl what happend to you?"
(she replies)
Girl... LL Cool J fucked the shit out of me. 
I am not sure but I think I even got gang banged by the entire city of compton by some niggas from NWA.
