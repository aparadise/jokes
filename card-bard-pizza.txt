joke: "free lunch and breakfrast at school" 


Damn day care is expensive. it cost 1,000.00 per kid to take to day care.
I remember when I was in the 3rd day walking back and forth from school with my own key to the house cooking my own food while my mom worked.  So I have no clue where all this baby sitting crap came from?

Hell we where poor so I wasent skiping school either. I be damn if i missed that free breakfast and lunch. A hot cinnoman roll was considered a healthy breakfast back in my day
and that cardbard pizza was the FIRST "Poppa Johns". 

As kids it was confussing every time we took a bite of that cafteria peppornoi pizza underneath of it said "Uhaul" we had thought that the name brand.
