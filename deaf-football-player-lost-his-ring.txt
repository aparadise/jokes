I am sure some of you guys might have heard by now that the deaf fullback for the
seahawks lost is superbowl ring.
But thank God it was found and return to his agent by the rent-a-car company.

the truth is what the media want tell you is this... HE NEVER LOST IT!!
NO HE I DIDNT!

Not everyone is sports fans and what happend was somebody who  worked at the rent-a-car company 
tried found it as he was leaving and they couldnt get his attention.
