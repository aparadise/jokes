Joke - "Korean BBQ" 7-2-14


(T2C)

Half of my life was lived in Kansas city and Oregon. So I want to say Sorry ahead of time for being so ignored. 
But I just NEVER heard of Korean BBQ until I moved to LA. NEVER! 

When I first heard of Korean BBQ I thought people was just being comically raciest like ....
"I thought Korean BBQ meant what would happend if we dropped a couple of bombs over there!"


(Stress)... Sorry I didnt know.
