joke. 
"Transgender boys run in girls track meet and win the 100 and 200 in England."


Now in England there is his huge uproar about how unfair these two "transgender" boys won the womens
100 and 200 meeters dash in the open high school event.


unfair? "Uhhhh no shit! hell yeah its unfair"


Well lets...

If Husan Bolt jumped in the 100meters dash in a all girls 5th grader field-day competion. And he smoked all them little heathens by 
50 meters and was high fiving everyone with a jamican colors saying those "those fucking girls was slow as shit! Bring on the 6th graders!"
Is that unfair???

If shaq showed up for my daughters pee-wee basketball game and i put him in at center. And shaq bragged about 
how the other teams cant score any points because he swatted every ball out the gym and broken 75 fisher price 
plastic backboards.
Is that unfair???


(t2c)
Come on folks. this is a no brainer of course its unfair.
The only thing that is confusing to me, is when it comes to transgenders is if I sex with one... does that mean
i had a 3-some in one night?
