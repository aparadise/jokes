joke. 
"Transgender boys run in girls track meet and win the 100 and 200 in England."


Now in England there is his huge uproar about how unfair these two "transgender" boys won the womens
100 and 200 meeters dash in the open high school event.


unfair? "Uhhhh no shit! hell yeah its unfair"


If Husan Bolt jumped in the 100meters dash of all girls 5th grade field-day competion. and i smoked them little heathens by 
50 meters and was high fiving everyone saying those "those fucking girls was slow as shit! Bring on the 6th graders!"

I can see shaq showing up for my daughters pee-wee basketball game and i put him in at center. should me and shaq brag about we
are the best ever since the other teams cant score any points and he swatted every ball out the gym and broken 75 fisher price 
plastic backboards.

Come on folks. this is a no brainer of course its unfair.
the only thing that is confusing to me when it comes transgenders is if I sex with one does that mean
i had a 3-some in one night.
