 with a first aid kit and all of that bullshit, (pause)  but (pause)  bitch

Cuz my kids will leave yo ass in the dust as soon as they see day light. 

How much can you bench press? Huh?

little asses out the store and back into the car.


And last but not least bitch what is your sound cadince like when you are in the huddle? Bitch when you are in the huddle are you in control?
