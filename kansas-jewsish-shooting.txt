I am sure by now you guys have heard about the ex-KKK leader did a drive by in Kansas city at 
a retired old folks holmes for Jewish people.

How gangsta is that!

The dude himself was 70 years old.

He busting caps and people yelling get down but they where so old they could hear 
andy of the gun shots.


Improv people on wheel chairs and shit.
